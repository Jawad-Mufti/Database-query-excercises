I didn't know that we should have written part 1 in a .sql file from the beggining, so we created it inside of postgresql and then exported the file. I don't have time to rewrite it to be functional so please import travel_planner.sql in postgresql and I've added a more readable human_readable_travel_planner.sql if you want to see how we create the database.
